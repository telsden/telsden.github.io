\roottitle{Research Area and Activity}

My research focusses on large scale plasma waves, known as ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves, in Earth's magnetosphere - the space around the Earth dominated by the Earth's magnetic field. These waves are an important aspect of space weather, driving aurora and radiation in near-Earth space. I use computational magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modelling to understand and predict the role of ULF waves in Earth's magnetospheric system.

\vspace{0.25cm}
\noindent I have written 30 research papers (27 published, 1 accepted, 2 in review), with 12 as first author and 8 as second author, in leading journals for my field such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR): Space Physics (18),
		\vspace{-0.25cm}
	\item Geophysical Research Letters (GRL)(3),
		\vspace{-0.25cm}
	\item Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Science (4),   
		\vspace{-0.25cm}
	\item Invited single author review to appear in Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Planetary Science,
		\vspace{-0.25cm}
	\item Invited book chapter in AGU Geophysical Monograph Series.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1cm} 
\noindent I have delivered over 35 external research talks, over 20 of which have been invited talks. I have regularly organised sessions at national and international conferences, as well as co-organising the largest UK summer school in my field, funded by STFC in 2023.

%My research involves the computational modelling of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in Earth magnetosphere - the space around the Earth dominated by the effects of Earth's magnetic field. These waves generate aurora by driving strong magnetic field-aligned currents and energise trapped particles which can be a hazardous form of radiation for orbiting spacecraft. I design and code computational models to solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to model and therefore physically understand the effect of ULF waves on the near-Earth space environment.

%Include full talk lists etc at end.
%Include PhD supervision, and examinations.
